Mobile Launch Platform
======================

A portable (cross-platform) EVE Online launcher

Screenshots & binary downloads: http://code.shishnet.org/eve-mlp/

Features
--------
- Remember usernames
- Remember passwords (one master password for several alts)
- Launch multiple alts at once
  - Different Eve folders for each of them, if you want to keep settings and cache separate
- Systray icon
  - Double click to hide main window
  - Right click -> launch character


Setup
-----
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-requests python-wxgtk2.8    # debian / ubuntu
$ sudo yum install python-requests wxPython               # red hat / fedora / centos

$ sudo pip install -e ./
```

Run
---
```
Run the gui:
    eve-gmlp
    
Command line with a specific eve install:
    eve-mlp --eve-dir /home/bob/Games/EVE

Launch multiple alts at once:
    eve-mlp --username Bob --username Fred --username Jim --username Dave

Store the passwords for known usernames, but don't actually launch eve:
    eve-mlp --save-passwords --dry

Launch all of your alts in one go, only needing to enter one master password:
    eve-mlp
```

Send ISK to Shish Tukay if you want to encourage more work on this :)
