		<p>In general, I try to make things clear enough to not need documentation;
		if there's anything you think could be clearer, let me know and I'll try to
		fix the app rather than documenting the problem.</p>
		<p>That said, some things that I can't think how to easily fix:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When picking a game folder, if you pick a junction point / symlink,
			the directory picker will pick the target of the link instead. To work
			around this, pick a folder <i>inside</i> the game folder (eg. "bin"),
			and MLP will automtically try the parent folder.</li>
			<li>For Linux and OSX users, the "wine command" and "wine flags" fields
			are separate so that you can have a common command as default (eg.
			"optirun /usr/bin/wine explorer") with separate flags for each character
			(eg. "/desktop=Main,1920x1080" for your main, "/desktop=Market,800x600"
			for your market alt)</li>
		</ul>
