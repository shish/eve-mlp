		<p>In general, I try to make things clear enough to not need documentation;
		if there's anything you think could be clearer, let me know and I'll try to
		fix the app rather than documenting the problem.</p>
		<p>That said, some things that I can't think how to easily fix:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When picking a game folder, if you pick a junction point / symlink,
			the directory picker will pick the target of the link instead. To work
			around this, pick a folder <i>inside</i> the game folder (eg. "bin"),
			and MLP will automtically try the parent folder.</li>
		</ul>
